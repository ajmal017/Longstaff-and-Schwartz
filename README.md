An implementation of the LSMC algorithm for American put options

This is an academic project, done under the supervision of prof.Mohamed Anis Ben Lasmar by my self Amin Jellali and my dear colleague Hatem bouguila.
in the report file you will find a (french) report explaining the algorithm step by step with all math needed.


The LSM.py file contains the actual implementation of the algorithm (commented step by step); the file you need to run.


The functions.py file is contains some functions that the algorithm calls(commented step by step).
